Mule SDK Concepts (what extension is, what do i need to develop one, when to develop one, how?)

Use the Mule SDK to develop functional components for use in Mule. You should be an experienced Java developer and understand the architecture of the service or system you are creating a module for. Additionally, you should be experienced with Mule.

What do I need to develop a module with SDK?

JDK 8
Maven
Mule 4
See how to set up Development Environment.

What are the prerequisites I need to have in mind?
Anypoint Connector knowledge
Learn code organization best practices for modules

What basic development steps do I follow?
Module main class
Configuration class
Operations Class
Error Type Definitions Class

What is the module code structure and the required annotations?


After coding the basic structure of my module, what should I do?
Understand how static and dynamic metadata retrieval are required to provide the user with the DataSense feature. It is important your module support Datasense
static - known at compile time
dynamic - based on connection configuration, resolved at user design time. All complex types must be defined as dynamic and must have a TypeResolver associated

How does Mule and my SDK module work together?



Creating a @Configuration Class


what is a configuration? what does a configuration do? do i need one? How do I specify the required parameters for a configuration? where do I save this? How do I reference it?

@ConnectionManagement

Handle connections, set up authentication here

@Operations for the Extension

Error Handling

block 
each error has a namespace within the connector
can say an operation throws these types of errors
way to add custom errors

ErrorTypes must implement ErrorTypeDefinition
This must be implemented in the extension code

@Throws can be put at many levels to throw an error, lowest level will output
ErrorTypeProvider must return a set of possible errors
ExceptionEnricher can add more information to Exception through @OnException

Can output a Mule message

Background reading: Extensions API

How it works with SDK Extension
How Mule discovers extension through API

Sources

one event, similar to req-rep / however, exchange patterns do not exist anymore
With the event that comes back from the source,
onSuccess and onError can be provided if the flow succeeds
You can fetch the error type that Mule throws
In Mule 3, there are start and stop methods in source class,
Now, onSource, and source callback, onStop receives nothing, but throws exception
What happens if source fails to start > onSourceException?
How to propagate state through source? Reference to connection and get it back on success and on error
How do you know on which connection to reply?
SourceCallbackContext
Cannot send a response to a source without onSuccess
Tell Studio you emit a response for your source using @EmitsResponse
It will be discarded if ???

Parameters

@NullSafe can be used on a POJO that is an object for optional parameters
Has to be list, map or pojo

Group parameters that are logically stored together.
ParameterGroup is not recursive in Mule 4
Each must have a name
Order and Placement, how is it different from Mule 3

DataWeave

Core data language in Mule
Access payload this way?

Operations

differentiate content from configuration
Use @Content to distinguish, but always mark the primary content with @Content(primary=true)
The primary content must always accept an exception
Default content is the payload
Non-primary content might be required and have their own defaults
When a parameter is content, it is in the element, you can embed it in the parameter
Instead of having to use two connectors to transform and write content, you can use dataweave as part of the runtime.

DataWeave does not change the payload because of the mapping. The operation, however, may change the payload
