= About Dependency Injection Annotations

All configurations and operations support dependency injection at the field level. To inject a dependency use the `@Inject` annotation. Any object in the Mule registry can be injected.

If many candidates of the same type are available, then apply the `@Named` annotation or `@Qualifier`.
