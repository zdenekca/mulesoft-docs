= About Analyzing API Data with External Tools
*This topic only applies to hybrid deployment scenarios.*

This topic describes the prerequisites for sending data from Anypoint Platform to external data analytics tools. It also provides a general discussion of the architecture.


== Basic Architecture

The Runtime Manager exists as:

* a component of the link:/getting-started/index[Anypoint Platform]
* a component of the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition that you can install on-premises

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition has a Runtime Manager that handles only applications that are deployed on-premises. The cloud-based version of Anypoint Platform has a Runtime Manager that allows you manage applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/index[CloudHub] as well as applications that are deployed on-premises and to your own cloud servers. When using whichever version of the Runtime Manager, there's always a way to monitor your applications. Applications deployed to CloudHub can use link:/runtime-manager/insight[Insight]: MuleSoft’s Analytics & Monitoring feature. Applications that you deploy on-premises or to your own cloud servers can be integrated into third-party analytics applications, which is what this document describes.

If you deploy apps from Runtime Manager to customer-managed Mule servers, you can send your Mule app event and analytics data to third party analytics software such as *Elk* and *Splunk*.

[NOTE]
Sending data to third party software is not currently available for applications on link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub[CloudHub]. See link:/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies[Deployment Strategies] for more details.

Integration between Runtime Manager and third-party analytics software looks like this:

The link:/runtime-manager/runtime-manager-agent[Runtime Manager Agent] acts in between Runtime Manager and the third party software. The agent enables integration and sends event notifications to your third party analytics tool.
