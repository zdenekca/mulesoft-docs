= Best Practices

Here's a summary of the SDK best practices, tips and tricks that we recommend you follow when developing your modules.

== Mind the end-to-end experience

Before publishing your module, try it in Studio and Flow Designer. Makes sure that it provides a good usability and experience. 
A module which works but is hard to use is not complete.

== Module  Java API
The SDK exports by package and not by class, the way that the SDK knows what packages to export is by introspecting each operation 
and sources return and input types and getting its packages. This means that you never want to share a package between an exported 
class and a not exported one.

Said that, the suggested package hierarchy is:

```
org.mule.salesforce
    .api.*
    .internal.*
```
Where _api.*_ contains all the classes that are going to be exported and seen by the application (Return Types, Subtypes, Input Types, 
Connection Client interfaces) and _internal.*_ contains all the classes that contains the specific behaviour of the module 
(Annotated classes, Connection and Operation implementations).

This way we separate both worlds and get a clear look on what should be exported and what should not.

== Types

All types *must* be DataWeave compliant. This means that all exposed types must have an empty constructor and a getter method 
for each field that should be usable.

== @ErrorTypes

* Mule works in terms of errors instead of exceptions. Each operation should declare which errors can be thrown, and each module 
defines its own errors.
* Use `ModuleException` to wrap an exception and enrich it with a custom error type.
* Exceptions classes should not be exported in your module.

== Config vs ConnectionProvider

* Config has all the parameters that control how the module works.
* `ConnectionProvider` has all the parameters needed to generate a connection.

== Expressions

By default, everything accepts expressions. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t have any sense to allow a parameter to be configured with an 
expression, you can disable that option with:

[source, java]
----
@Expression(NOT_SUPPORTED)
----

== Do not access the MuleContext
The only reason why a module would need access to the `MuleContext` is to obtain certain Runtime services. Use `@Inject` to 
obtain those services instead. 

For example, instead of:

[source, java]
----
muleContext.getRegistry().lookupByType(MyClass.class)
----

use

[source, java]
----
public class MyComponent {
    @Inject
    MyClass myClass;
}
----

== Transactions
Non transactional operations should not receive a transactional connection. The SDK will make those operation transactional and in 
in Studio the user will be wrongfully presented with transactional options.

== Use Mule HTTP client

* Do not use Jersey or similar Http library. Use the Mule HTTP service. That will give you access to all the features of the 
http requester, including non blocking execution.
* Pay special attention to endpoints which require TLS. Make sure you initialise the `TlsContextFactory` correctly.

== Misc

* Do not use boxed booleans. Only native booleans are allowed. All `boolean` parameters will be considered optional and defaulting to
`false`. You can use the `@Optional` annotation to change the default of a particular `boolean`, but you can never make it a requried 
parameter.
* Use plural names for `List` or `Array` parameters
* Remember to use the `@ConfigOverride` whenever you want an operation to override a configuration setting
* Use `@DefaultEncoding` to obtain the runtime's default encoding
* `@Nullsafe`: Use it whenever it makes sense to avoid `NullPointerException` problems
* Dates: do not use `java.util.Date` or `java.util.Calendar`` use Java 8 `java.time.LocalDate` instead
