= Sending asynchronous responses from a Message Source
:keywords: mule, sdk, sources, listener, triggers, response, output, asynchronous

When sending responses, some sources might do it in an asynchronous way.

Main uses cases for async sources are (but not limited to):

* Response operation is non-blocking way
* Response operation is blocking, but it's asynchronously executed in a thread other than the one which 
initiates it (most typically, the thread executing a method annotated with `OnSuccess` or `OnError`
* The source wants to perform asynchronous auditing for which it needs to consume a response stream in a 
separate thread

In those cases, the runtime needs to know that the response will be asynchronous because otherwise there 
will be a race condition between the thread emitting the response and the runtime which is trying to free
up resources associated with the message being responded to.

In those use cases, the methods annotated with `OnSuccess` or `OnError` must have an argument
of type `SourceCompletionCallback`. That's enough to signal the runtime that the source is an async one.

The runtime will not finish the associated event until either the `success()` or `error(Throwable)` methods are invoked.
Notice this is a very strong contract. A source which requests a `SourceCompletionCallback` but then doesn't 
properly notifies it is one likely to eventually freeze the entire runtime!.

Let's see a quick example:
[source, java, linenums]
----
@OnSuccess
   public void onSuccess(@Content String response, SourceCompletionCallback callback) {
     asyncResponder.sendResponse(response, new ResponderCallback() {
         void onSuccess() {
           callback.success();
         }
 
         void onFailure(Throwable t) {
          callback.error(t);
        }
       }
     }
