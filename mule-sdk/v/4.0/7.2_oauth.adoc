= OAuth

OAuth is an authentication protocol used by many APIs in order to allow an application to act in behalf of a user 
without the need to actually shared the user's credentials. If you are unfamiliar with the protocol, please visit
link:https://oauth.net/2/[this link].

The SDK provides supports for building modules which are _OAuth enabled_, which means that they establish connections 
which are authenticated through the OAuth protocol. This allows to hide most of the complexities of the OAuth protocol (which is 
a *VERY* complex one) from the end user, providing a simpler, easier experience which doesn't require to go through the 
learning curve of OAuth.

The OAuth support provided by the SDK is limited to:

* OAuth version 2
* Only the Authorization grant type is supported at the moment
