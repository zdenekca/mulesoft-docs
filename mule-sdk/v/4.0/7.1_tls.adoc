[[_tls]]
= TLS Authentication

Adding support for TLS configuration in your module is as simple declaring a parameter of type `TlsContextFactory`

Just take a look at the following example:

[source, java]
----
@Parameter
@Optional
private TlsContextFactory tlsContextFactory;
----
  
This will automatically generate support for this XML setting:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<tls:context enabledProtocols="TLSv1.2,SSLv3">
    <tls:trust-store path="ssltest-cacerts.jks" password="changeit"/>
    <tls:key-store path="ssltest-keystore.jks" keyPassword="changeit" password="changeit"/>
</tls:context> 
----

Take into consideration that a TLS context can also be defined as a global element of your application so you can reference it by its name anywhere you need it.
