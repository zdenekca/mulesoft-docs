[[_tls]]
= TLS Authentication

Adding support for TLS configuration in your module is as simple as declaring a <<_parameters, parameter>> of type `TlsContextFactory`

Just take a look at the following example:

[source, java]
----
@Parameter
@Optional
private TlsContextFactory tlsContextFactory;
----
  
This will automatically generate support for this XML setting:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<tls:context enabledProtocols="TLSv1.2,SSLv3">
    <tls:trust-store path="my-trust-store.jks" password="myPassword"/>
    <tls:key-store path="my-key-store.jks" keyPassword="myPassword" password="myPassword"/>
</tls:context> 
----

Take into consideration that a TLS context can also be defined as a global element of your application, 
so you can reference it by its name anywhere you need it.

To see how to correctly configure TLS context and all the available parameters that you can set please head to the reference for Mule TLS Context. // TODO link a mule TLS
