= External Libraries
:keywords: mule, SDK, library, dependency, external, jar, maven

== Concept
Connectors and Modules can depend on external libraries and sometimes these can not
be packaged inside the connector, due to several causes: _licensing, versioning, custom libs, etc_.

An example of this case is the *Database Connector* in which with the same
base code you can work with several drivers and versions of a same driver.
The solution for this problem is to not package any driver inside the connector,
but asking the Mule developer to provide the desired *JDBC Driver* based on
to what he requires to connect to.

== Usage
To declare that the Connector or Module requires a external library to work
when is used in a Mule Application, you should annotate with the `@ExternalLib`
annotation an <<1.0_structure_intro.adoc#_structure, Extension>>,
<<1.2_configs.adoc#_configs, Configuration>> or <<1.3_connections.adoc#_connections, Connection>>
and fill all the properties that will help the Mule App developer how
to configure these libraries.

TIP: Is highly recommended to fill, if possible, all the properties that this
annotation provides, this will help the Mule App developer how to configure
these libraries more easily.

.@ExternalLib Usage Example
[source, java, linenums]
----
@ExternalLib(name = "MySQL JDBC Driver",
description = "A JDBC driver which supports connecting to the MySQL Database",
nameRegexpMatcher = "(.*)\\.jar",
requiredClassName = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver",
coordinates = "mysql:mysql-connector-java:5.1.44")
public class MySqlConnectionProvider implements ConnectionProvider<> {
  //
}
----

TIP: A Connector can required multiple external libraries, the `@ExternalLib`
annotation can be used many times as needed.

=== Properties

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
| Property | Required | Type | Description
| *name* | true | String | Friendly name to be displayed in the UI
| *description* | false | String | Short explanation about the external library
| *nameRegexpMatcher* | false | String | Regex expression used to match the name
of the library's file and validate that the specified library by the Mule developer
is the correct one.
| *requiredClassName* | false | String | _(Only for Java Libraries)_ Name of a
`Class` that will be present in the external library. This will be used to validate
if the specified library by the Mule developer is the correct one.
| *type* | true | Enum | *NATIVE*: Native library dependency +
*JAR*: Jar file dependency +
*DEPENDENCY*: External dependency (for example, a dependency obtained that is specified in the `pom.xml` if you are using Maven)
| *coordinates* | false | String | Maven coordinates suggestion which indicates where the required library can be found. They should follow Maven's convention `groupId:artifactId:packaging:classifier:version`.
| *optional* | false | boolean | Indicates whether the library is not required for the functioning of the Connector or Module.
