toc::[]

While the integration developer can use a poll scope and an operation to poll an inbound endpoint, there are several cases which require a "message source":

* HTTP listener
* File watcher
* JMS/AMQP to receive messages from queues subscribed to
* Streaming API, and other cases

As mentioned, a *poll scope* and *operation* can perform a similar function to that of a message source. Some similarities between the two are that they both have:

* Parameters
* return type
* Name and Description
* Interceptors
* Reconnection capabilities

|Operations |Message Sources
|Operations work inside an `OperationContext` which wraps a `MuleEvent` |Message sources create an `OperationContext` which in turn creates a `MuleEvent`, thus wrapping it
|Operation lifecycle is tied to the containing flow
|Message sources can be started/stopped independently of the containing flow
|Operations support dynamic configurations obtained based on the received event
|Message sources cannot have dynamic configurations because there is no event. Configuration is assigned at event start time and is fixed
|Any operation parameter has the option of accepting expressions.
|Sources have a clear definition of which parameters can accept expressions and which cannot. Only parameters which are part of a callback can accept them.
|An operation can have lifecycle, but its parameter values are unavailable, and unnecessary |A message source must have `start()` and `stop()` phases and they may require access to parameter values
|A connection is obtained from the `ConnectionManager` each time the operation is executed |A connection is obtained each time the message source is started or when reconnection happens.
|===

Sources must implement the source class which takes two generics: one for the type of the generated event payload and another one for the type of the attributes:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@Alias("listener")
@MetadataScope(outputResolver = HttpListenerMetadataResolver.class)
@EmitsResponse
public class HttpListener extends Source<Object, HttpRequestAttributes> {
----

You can use the `@Alias` annotation to force a name to use instead of the one SDK infers.
You can use `@MetadataScope` and the other DataSense annotations.

== Response or No Response

One of the main properties of a message source is whether or not it generates a response. To specify that your source has the capability of generating a response, it must be annotated with `@EmitsResponse`.

Note that this is added to tell the runtime and tooling that the source has response capability.

[NOTE]
====
Realize that the SDK nor the runtime will validate that:

* a source which emits response actually does so
* a source which doesn’t declare itself to emit response is prevented from sending one
====

=== Sources that do not Emit a Response

Examples of sources which do not emit a response are:

* file listener
* Salesforce streaming API
* poll element
* source which listens for async push notifications


=== Sources that May Emit a Response

Sources that may emit a response:

* TCP Server
* HTTP server
* JMS server

This classification is *non-deterministic* by nature. Take for example an HTTP server that supports sending a response, though the user chooses not to have the source send one.
Another example: although a JMS listener might respond by sending a message to a reply queue, conversely it might be configured not to respond.

=== Summary of Response Behavior

Even though a message source has the capability of sending a response, it doesn’t necessarily imply that it will respond, even if the message was processed successfully. There are logic or configuration circumstances that might warrant foregoing response generation.

== onStart() and onStop()

Message sources can be started or stopped at any time, independently of their containing flow. To this effect `onStart()` and `onStop()` methods must be defined:

[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
* This method will be invoked by the runtime to make the source start
* producing messages.
* <p>
* Each generated message will be passed back to the runtime through the
* given {@code sourceCallback} for processing.
* <p>
* This method should throw an exception if the source fails to start, but
* any other exception encountered during the process of generating messages,
* should be communicated to the runtime through the {@link SourceCallback#onSourceException(Throwable)}
* method.
* <p>
* Only the runtime should invoke this method. Do not do it manually
*
* @param sourceCallback a {@link SourceCallback}
* @throws MuleException If the source fails to start.
*/
public abstract void onStart(SourceCallback<T, A> sourceCallback) throws MuleException;


/**
* This method will be invoked by the runtime to make the source stop producing messages.
* <p>
* This method should not fail. Any exceptions found during the stop process should be
* logged and correctly handled by the source, but after invoking this method the source
* must:
* <ul>
* <li>Stop producing messages</li>
* <li>Free any allocated resources</li>
* <li>Be capable of being restarted</li>
* </ul>
* <p>
* Only the runtime should invoke this method. Do not do it manually
*/
public abstract void onStop();
----

Since sources define their own lifecycle mechanism, they cannot implement any of the standard Mule lifecycle interfaces (`Initialisable`, `Startable`, `Stoppable`, `Disposable`).

=== onStart()

After `onStart()` is invoked, the source should be aware of any event that triggers the generation of a new message and successfully push the new message to the containing flow.

[IMPORTANT]
Do not invoke this method in your code. Only the runtime invokes this method, for example, upon starting the flow.

This method must receive a `SourceCallback` object as a parameter. The `SourceCallback` is the API through which the source will push data to the flow. The data is pushed in the form of a `Result` object, and the runtime translates the object into a Mule message.

This method should throw an exception if the source fails to start, but any other exceptions produced while listening/triggering new messages should be communicated through the `SourceCallback` (see the link:SDK/error-handling[Error Handling] section).


=== onStop()

The `onstop()` method is invoked by the runtime to stop the source from producing messages.

[IMPORTANT]
Do not invoke this method in your code. Only the runtime invokes this method.

This method should not fail. To that effect, any exceptions found during the stop process should be logged and correctly handled by the source, but after invoking this method the source must:

* stop producing messages
* free any allocated resources
* be capable of being restarted

[TIP]
Best practice dictates that the source should never keep a hard reference to the `SourceCallback`, because the source needs to be restartable and a new instance of `SourceCallback` must provided on each invocation of `onStart()`. Keeping a reference to the callback on a field or some other container will force you to have clean up logic for it. This applies to the source state in general, therefore avoid creating such references.

== Sending Messages to the Flow

Once the source generates an object to be sent to the flow, it does so through the `SourceCallback`. Here’s some example code taken from the HTTP connector:

[source,java,linenums]
----
SourceCallbackContext context = sourceCallback.createContext();
context.addVariable(RESPONSE_CONTEXT, responseContext);
sourceCallback.handle(createResult(requestContext), context);
----

The `handle()` method is used to push data into the flow. That data is pushed in the form of a `Result` object, which is the same `Result` object that operations use when they need to set a payload value as well as attributes (most sources will need to set attributes.) For example, the File source sets an attributes object which contains metadata about a file, whereas the HTTP listener instantiates an object which contains information about the incoming HTTP request.

Notice that the `sourceCallback` is used to created a `SourceCallbackContext`. The callback context is used to maintain state across messages. For example, in the case of HTTP, each message needs a reference to the client which placed the original request, so that a response can be sent back. Because the source will be processing several requests concurrently, each message must to be tied to a specific state.

In the “Callback Methods” section of this document you see how this same HTTP listener utilizes that variable to emit a response.

[IMPORTANT]
The only legal way of creating a SourceCallbackContext object is through a SourceCallback, which will only accept context objects created by it.

For certain sources (like ones that do not emit responses), there’s probably no need to keep any state for the message. For those cases, there’s an overload of the `handle()` method which just accepts the `Result` object without the need of a context.

== Declaring Parameters

As explained before there’s a hybrid approach to declaring a source, because of the diverse nature of the possible parameters.


=== Obtaining the Configuration

Just like an operation, a source might reference a configuration to obtain parameters about its behavior. To obtain such configuration, a field is to be annotated with the `@UseConfig` annotation (the same annotation that can be used in operations arguments to inject a configuration):

[source,java,linenums]
----
@EmitsResponse
public class HttpListener extends Source<Object, HttpRequestAttributes> {

@Inject
private MuleContext muleContext;

@UseConfig
private HttpListenerConfig config;
----
[NOTE]
The `@Inject` annotation can be used on fields to achieve Dependency Injection, such as can be achieved in any other Mule component.

=== Obtaining a Connection

If the source requires a connection (and most connectors will, unless you’re implementing a scheduler or a poll), then you need to obtain such a connection through a connection provider. Once again, we use the same annotation as operations, except it is applied to a field instead of an argument.
//operations can use the @Connection annotation?

[source,java,linenums]
----
@EmitsResponse
public class HttpListener extends Source<Object, HttpRequestAttributes> {

@UseConfig
private HttpListenerConfig config;

@Connection
private Server server;
----

=== Source Behavior Parameters

Some parameters are defined using fields. These are the fields which are used to give the source the necessary configuration to start and stop. Since these parameters are used in the message generation process and are used at a point in which a message not yet exists, they cannot accept expressions.

Other parameters, are defined in methods annotated with `@OnSuccess` and `@OnError`, which we’ll explain next.

=== Callback Parameters

Once the flow is finished processing each of the messages generated by the source, the source might optionally need to obtain the response that the flow has generated. We can do this by declaring methods annotated with `@OnSucess` or `@OnError`. These methods are declared in a similar fashion as operations, but they need to be void, since they listener for the response but cannot alter it.

Each of the parameters in these callback methods will be evaluated in the same manner as operations (including auto transformation). However, since these callback methods are executed in response to the runtime processing a message, they can actually accept expressions. In fact, they accept expressions by default.
//see first sentence, what does this mean: including auto transformation?

== Callback Methods

Callback methods are used to tap into the responses generated by the flow that encapsulates the source.

The `@OnSuccess` method executes when the flow successfully processes the message (either because no errors were thrown or because they were all handled gracefully). The `@OnError` method is executed when an unhandled error is thrown by the flow.

[source,java,linenums]
----
@OnSuccess
public void onSuccess(@Optional @DisplayName(RESPONSE_SETTINGS) @NullSafe HttpListenerSuccessResponseBuilder responseBuilder,
                     SourceCallbackContext callbackContext)
   throws Exception {


 HttpResponseContext context = callbackContext.getVariable(RESPONSE_CONTEXT);
 responseSender.sendResponse(context, responseBuilder);
}
----

This example taken from the HTTP connector shows how the `onSuccess()` callback method can:

* Receive a complex parameter, using the same annotations as a regular operation would.
* Receive a `SourceCallbackContext` parameter. This allows the callback method to obtain the same callback context which was pushed alongside the original payload (or a default one).
* In this case, this source is actually pulling a variable from the context in order to use it
* emit responses; this is the place to actually send it

Now let’s see an `@OnError `method from the same connector:

[source,java,linenums]
----
@OnError
public void onError(
                   @Optional @DisplayName(ERROR_RESPONSE_SETTINGS) @NullSafe HttpListenerErrorResponseBuilder errorResponseBuilder,
                   SourceCallbackContext callbackContext,
                   Error error) {
}
----

In this case, the method is very similar to the successful one. It also receives parameters and the callback context, and sends an error response back to the requester. But it can also receive an `Error` object. This is the actual Mule `Error` object which contains the information about the failure that was caught.

=== Content Parameters


The callbacks accept content parameters just like any operation. In the case of the http connector, it makes sense for the HttpListenerResponseBuilder to use them to allow the use of DataWeave into transforming the flow’s result into whatever format that the connector intends to return. All the concepts of content and primary contents apply, as well as their associated restrictions.

=== Gotchas

Even if the source doesn’t emit responses, it might still need to have callback methods for releasing resources, for logging, auditing, etc.

A source is not required to provide both `@OnSuccess` and `@OnError` methods. They can just declare the ones they need or none at all

== Types of Sources and Example Sources

The following are two canonical examples of message sources, which are representative of the possible approaches:

* link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/60a749ea1de5ac4d2452bbb37595772f86aa5a48/extensions/file/src/main/java/org/mule/extension/file/internal/DirectoryListener.java[Directory Listener] in the file connector
* link:https://github.com/mulesoft/mule/blob/7505e871af307850bef9d6f259e78c05ec282023/modules/http/src/main/java/org/mule/extension/http/internal/listener/HttpListener.java[HTTP listener] in the HTTP connector

These show three main categories of sources:
//MG: three categories: blocking, polling, callback sources?

=== Blocking/Polling Sources

This is the example of the Directory Listener. In this case, it’s up to the source to go fetch data, either by parking at a blocking API (in this case `watcher.take()`) or by polling at some other API at regular intervals. In either case, the source needs to have its own WorkManager/Scheduler threading API we define to handle threads to take care of this.

Notice that in this case, the `onSourceException()` method of the `SourceCallback` becomes especially important. Because the actual listening happens on a thread proprietary to the source, you can’t just throw an exception an except mule to catch it and know what to do with it. Such error needs to be communicated through the callback.

=== Callback Sources

See the HTTP Listener or the Salesforce Connector. In this example, there is a third-party library/client which is in control of triggering the events. This library pushes data to the source which then pushes it back to the runtime.
