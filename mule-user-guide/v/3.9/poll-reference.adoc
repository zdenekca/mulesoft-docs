While some connectors, such as link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/http-connector[HTTP] and link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/ftp-connector[FTP], utilize a polling process to actively retrieve messages from an external resource, most message processors in Mule are triggered when called by a previous element in a flow. If you want to arrange for a message processor to actively call a resource at regular intervals, use a Poll scope.

[TIP]
For greater flexibility, you can also configure your Poll scope to use a Cron expression, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/poll-schedulers[Poll Scheduler].

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Visual Editor in Anypoint Studio] that you can use to create applications in Studio. Further, this document references link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/global-elements[Global Elements] and the category of message processors known as link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/scopes[scopes].  Review link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/[Anypoint Studio Essentials] to learn more about developing with Mule's graphical user interface. 

== Configuring a Poll Wrapper

[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....

. Drag a *Poll* scope onto the canvas.
+
image:poll_scope.png[poll_scope]
+
. Drag an element inside the poll scope, for example a *Twitter* connector. Mule uses this message processor to regularly poll the Twitter API for new data to process. +
+
image:poll_connector.png[poll_connector]
+
. Configure the Twitter Connector:
.. Click the green plus sign to the right of *Connector Configuration*:
+
image:poll-twitter-properties.png[poll-twitter-properties]
+
.. Log into link:https://www.twitter.com[twitter.com] and sign in. If you don't have a Twitter account, create one.
.. Change your browser location to https://apps.twitter.com.
.. Click *Create New App*. You need to specify an app name, description, web site URL, a callback URL, and agree to their developer agreement. You can use `+http://www.example.com+` for both the web site URL and callback URL as placeholders until you have actual URLs (if you plan to make your app available to others).
.. Click the *Keys and Access Tokens* tab, and click *Create my access token*.
.. Copy the following credentials from your Twitter API application page to the Twitter connector configuration:
+
image:poll-twitter-config.png[poll-twitter-config]
+
** Consumer Key
** Consumer Secret
** Access Token
** Access Token Secret
. Click *Test Connection* to ensure your credentials are correct.
. Click *OK*.
. In the Twitter properties screen, click the drop-down menu for *Operation* and:
+
`Get user timeline by screen name`
+
. Set the *Screen Name* to `MuleSoft`. You can leave the remainder of the settings at their default values:
+
image:twitter.png[Twitter connector properties settings]
+
. Add more message processors to your flow to perform specific business logic after polling for data. The example below uses a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/logger-component-reference[logger] component. This logger uses the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/mule-expression-language-mel[MEL] expression `#[payload]` to log the message payload collected by the Twitter connector every 1000 milliseconds.
+
image:poll_flow.png[poll_flow]

....
[tab,title="XML Editor or Standalone"]
....

. Add a Poll element to your flow.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Element |Description |Sample XML
|*poll* |Polls an element at regular intervals. |`<poll frequency=` `"1000"` `doc:name=` `"Poll"` `>`
|===
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute name |Value |Description |Sample XML
|*frequency* |integer |The interval, in milliseconds, between calls. When set to 0 or a negative value, it switches to the default. |`frequency="1000"`
|*doc:name* |string | *(Studio only)* Displays a unique name for the poll scope in your application. |`doc:name="Poll"`
|===
+
. Add a Twitter connector as a child element of the poll element.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Child Element |Description |Sample XML
|*twitter:<operation>* |Connects to Twitter. The "operation" is the activity Twitter performs. In the example at right, show recent tweets by a particular Twitter user. |`<twitter:get-user-timeline-by-screen-name config-ref=` `"Twitter"` `screenName=` `"mulesoft"` `doc:name=` `"Twitter"` `/>`
|===
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Attribute name |Value |Description |XML
|*screenName* |string |Twitter account to return tweets from. In this example, the official MuleSoft account; you can use any valid Twitter account. |`screenName="MuleSoft"`
|*config-ref* |string |You must create a Twitter connector as a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/global-elements[global element] to reference here. For your Twitter connector, you need a Twitter developer account. |`config-ref=` `"Twitter"`
|*doc:name* |string | *(Studio only.)* Name of the poll scope as it displays in your application. |`doc:name=` `"Twitter"`
|===
. Add more message processors to your flow to perform specific business logic after polling for data. The example below uses a link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/logger-component-reference[logger] component. This logger uses the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/mule-expression-language-mel[MEL] expression `#[payload]` to log the message payload collected by the Twitter connector every 1000 milliseconds.
+
[%header%autowidth.spread]

== Pausing Polling During Debugging

While trying to debug an application that utilizes polling functionality, it is challenging to constantly trigger flow processing so as to monitor Mule activity. To trigger polling during testing, use the *Poll Resume* and *Poll Pause* mechanisms available with Studio's Visual Debugger.

. Run your project in Debug Mode. (Refer to the link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/studio-visual-debugger[Visual Debugger] document for greater detail.)
. In debug mode, notice the set of buttons in the title bar of the Poll scope (see image below). Use the green **Poll Start-Pause** button to trigger the poll and initiate the flow; click again to halt polling.
+
image:poll_debug.png[poll_debug]

. While running your project in debug mode, Studio opens a new *Mule Debugger View* tab the lower section of the screen. In the top-right of this tab, Studio displays two icons which allow you to stop or start all polls in your project at the same time.
+
image:poll_startStop.png[poll_startStop]

== Polling for Updates using Watermarks

Rather than polling a resource for _all_ its data with every call, you may want to acquire only the data that has been newly created or updated since the last call. To acquire only new or updated data, you need to keep a persistent record of either the item that was last processed, or the time at which your flow last polled the resource. In the context of Mule flows, this persistent record is called a *watermark*.

Typically, Mule sets a watermark to a default value the first time the flow runs, then uses it as necessary when running a query or making an outbound request (that is, calling a resource). Depending upon how the flow processes the results of the call, Mule may update the original value of the watermark or maintain the original value. As the value must persist across flows, Mule uses an object store for persistent storage. Built into the poll scope, object stores require no custom logic. You can configure watermarks by setting a couple of attributes.

Consider the following generic Mule flow.

image:watermark-expbasic.png[watermark-expbasic]

This flow regularly polls a resource, then performs a series of operations on the resulting payload. With every poll, the application acquires only the data that is newly created or updated since the last call to the resource. In this example, Mule stores watermarks in two variables:

* A persistent object store variable 
* An exposed flow variable

[NOTE]
If you're already comfortably familiar with Mule components in general, you might find link:https://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/mule-dev/data-synchronizing-made-easy-with-mule-watermarks/[this blog post] to be a clear explanation, as it explains the watermark by replicating its behavior with a series of other Mule components.

The diagram below illustrates same flow including numbered steps. The step-by-step explanation below describes the activities Mule performs in the background with these two variables.

image:watermark-w-selectors.png[watermark-w-selectors]

.  Mule looks for a variable in the object store with a name that matches the value of the Poll attribute `"Variable Name"`. In this case the chosen name is `lastModifiedID`.
.  If Mule finds a variable by this name, Mule exposes it by creating a flow variable (`flowVar`) with the same name.
+
[NOTE]
The first time the poll runs, no object store variable exists by this name. In this case, Mule creates a flow variable anyway, and loads it with the value you provide in the `Default Expression` attribute. In this case, the initial value is 0.

. Mule polls the resource. Connectors inside the poll should include filters that accept the `flowVars` as an attribute, as per the code below.
+
[source, code]
----
sinceId="#[flowVars['lastModifiedID']]"
----

. Mule executes the rest of the flow. +
. When the flow has completed execution, Mule updates the value of the flowVars according to either the  *`Update Expression`* or a combination of the *`Selector Expression`* and the chosen *`Selector`*. In this case, the Selector Expression is `#[payload.id]`, and the Selector is `LAST`, so Mule inspects the ID attribute of each of the returned objects and picks the last of these as the new value for the `lastmodifiedID` flowVars.
. Mule saves the flowVars back into the object store. If no variable existed in the object store in step 1, Mule creates a new variable in the object store.
+
[TIP]
If you define a value in the optional "`Object Store`" poll attribute, Mule searches for an object store by your value instead of the default user object store.

=== List of Watermark Attributes

[%header,cols="20a,80a"]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|*Variable Name* |Identifies both the *object store key* that Mule uses to store the watermark, and the name of the *flowVars* where Mule exposes the watermark value to the user.

*XML Element*: `variable` +
*Required?*: Yes +
*Default*: None
|*Default Expression* |If Mule cannot locate the object store key it uses the default expression to generate a value. This is useful for the first run of the flow.

*XML Element*: `default-expression` +
*Required?*: Yes +
*Default*: None
|*Update Expression* |Mule uses the result of this expression to update the watermark once flow execution is complete. Use this expression as an alternative to a selector in case you need to follow a more complex logic.

*XML Element*: `update-expression` +
*Required?*: No +
*Default*: Value of the variable attribute.
|*Selector* |The criteria Mule uses to pick the next value for the flowVars. There are four available selectors: MIN, MAX, FIRST, and LAST. If you use this attribute, you must also provide a value for Selector Expression.

*XML Element*: `selector` +
*Required?*: No +
*Default*: None
|*Selector Expression* |Mule executes this expression on every object returned by the Poll. The Selector then collects the returned values and picks one according to the chosen criteria. If you use this attribute, you must also provide a value for the Selector.

*XML Element*: `selector-expression` +
*Required?*: No +
*Default*: None
|*Object Store* |The default user object store. A reference to the object store in which you wish to store the watermarks.

*XML Element*: `object-store-ref` +
*Required?*: No +
*Default*: None

=== Variation For Updating the Flow Variable

As described above, the watermark element includes two ways to update the flow variable (`flowVars`) every time flow execution completes:

* Set an expression in the attribute `update-expression`
* Set an expression in the attribute `selector-expression`, and a criteria in `selector`

However, neither of these options support exception handling strategies; you may wish to add more complex logic rules to the process of updating the flow variable. To do so, you can use other message processors in your flow to set the flow variable using custom logic.

Add code, such as the example below, into a Java class, wrapping your extra custom logic around it. 

[source]
----
#[flowVars['lastModifiedID']] = #[payload.id]
----

[CAUTION]
If you use custom logic to update the `flowVars`, click the radio button for `update-expression`, but leave the field empty. If the `update-expression` attribute has a value, Mule stores new watermark information on the `flowVars` according to that attribute, and overwrites any custom logic you may have defined for updating the variable.

The image below displays a sample flow that updates the flowVars using custom logic; note the empty `update-expression` attribute.

image:watermark-expcomplex.png[watermark-expcomplex]

== Using Watermarks with Auto-Paging

Any connector which is enabled for link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/auto-paging-in-anypoint-connectors[auto-paging] allows you to process large data sets in separate batches. This capability mitigates for memory overload, but also imposes certain conditions when used in conjunction with watermarks. The following example illustrates the recommended method for using watermarks when polling a connector that auto-pages its response.

The main difficulty when dealing with auto-paging connectors is that collection object that they output can only be iterated through once. Selecting a watermark, such as the maximum value, would require iterating through the collection, which would consume it. Therefore, this action is not performed in the poll element, but rather when you iterate through the collection later in your flow, such as when you apply a for each element.


[tabs]
------
[tab,title="Studio Visual Editor"]
....

. Place an auto-paging-enabled connector, such as *Salesforce* inside a *poll* scope.
+
image:ex11.png[ex11]
+
. Configure the connector according to the following screenshot. Note that the query orders the output in ascending order of `LastModifiedDate` so that the last item in the list is the newest. This detail is critical. This screen sets the following values:
+
** Display name: `Salesforce`
** Config Reference: `Salesforce`
** Operation: `Query`
** Language: `DataSense Query Language`
** Query Text: (combine into one line in the connector's field)
+
[source,sql,linenums]
----
SELECT Email,FirstName,LastModifiedDate,LastName FROM Contact WHERE
LastModifiedDate > #[flowVars['nextSync']] ORDER BY LastModifiedDate
ASC LIMIT 100
----
+
image:salesforce.png[salesforce]
+
[WARNING]
Be sure to configure the order of the output so that the LAST element in the collection is the most recent one!
+
Configure the poll scope according to the table below. The watermark is a variable named `lastUpdated`. When you iterate through the collection, later in your flow, Mule updates the value of the variable to the value you put in the Selector field, in this case `#[payload['lastUpdated']]`. Its default value is the result of evaluating the following expression: `#['YESTERDAY']`.
+
image:withselector.png[withselector]
+
[%header,cols="34,33,33"]
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Sample XML
|*Variable Name* |The watermark is a variable named `lastUpdated` |`variable=` `"lastUpdated"`
|*default-expression* |The default value of `lastUpdated` is the result of evaluating `#['YESTERDAY']`. |`default-expression=#['YESTERDAY']`
|*Selector* |Criteria to pick which value to use, out of all of the ones in the collection |`selector="MAX"`
|*Selector Expression* |Mule updates `lastUpdated` to the Maximum value in the collection of `#[payload['lastUpdated']]` |`selector-expression=#[payload['lastUpdated']]`
|===
. Next, you need to process the output of the connector with an element that can handle collections, such as a `foreach` scope (for more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/foreach[foreach]). The message processors set within the Foreach scope process each item in a collection individually, one at a time. While it iterates through the collection, it communicates with the poll scope, sending it the selector values so that the MAX can be picked.
+
[WARNING]
Keep in mind that when dealing with collections with auto-paging, you need to process the collection at some point of your flow. If you don't, the selector in your poll won't be updated.
+
image:ex12.png[ex12]

. Inside the Foreach scope, place a Logger. Set its message to `#[payload['lastUpdated]]`, which logs the time of the last update for every element in your collection.

....
[tab,title="XML Editor or Standalone"]

. Add a *poll* element to your flow, then add a *watermark variable* as a child element. The watermark is a variable named `lastUpdated`. When the flow has finished processing, Mule updates the value of the variable to the value of the *flow variable* by the same name, `lastUpdated`. Its default value is the result of evaluating the following expression: `#['YESTERDAY']`.

Next, you need to process the output of the connector with an element that can handle collections, such as a `foreach` scope (for more information, see link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.9/foreach[foreach]). The message processors set within the Foreach scope process each item in a collection individually, one at a time. While it iterates through the collection, it communicates with the poll scope, sending it the selector values so that the MAX can be picked.
+
[WARNING]
Keep in mind that when dealing with collections with auto-paging, you need to process the collection at some point of your flow. If you don't, the selector in your poll won't be updated.
. Inside the Foreach scope, place a Logger. Set its message to `#[payload['lastUpdated]]`, which logs the time of the last update for every element in your collection.

== Polling in a Cluster

When running in a cluster, only the server identified as the primary node performs the polling. In case the primary node goes down, then another node in the cluster becomes the primary node and starts polling instead (failover).
